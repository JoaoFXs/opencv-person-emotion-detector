# Key Features
- Facial Recognition: Identifies faces in images and compares them against a pre-trained database
- Emotion Detection: Classifies facial expressions into 7 categories (angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, neutral)
- Training System: Allows training models with new images for personalized recognition
- Result Visualization: Displays images with detected faces and identified emotions

# Technologies Used
- Python 3
## Libraries:
- face_recognition
- dlib
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn
- DeepFace
- Pillow
- seaborn and matplotlib for visualization

# Installation
To run this project, install the dependencies with:
```bash
pip install face_recognition opencv-python scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib deepface
```
# Project Structure
The main code contains:
- Initial setup: Loading pre-trained facial detection models
##Processing functions:
- face_encodings: Generates facial feature vectors
- _raw_face_locations: Detects faces in images
## Model training:
- Data splitting into training, validation, and test sets
## Data normalization
- Logistic Regression training
- Emotion detection: Uses DeepFace library for emotional analysis
- Visualization: Plotting results and confusion matrices

# How to Use
1. Prepare a directory with training images, organized in subfolders by person
2. Execute the main() function with the image folder path and a location to save the model
3. To test with new images, use the process_new_image() function

## Example:
```python
folder_path = "/path/to/training_images"
model_path = "/path/to/trained_model.h5"
```
1. Train or load model
```python
clf, names, scaler = main(folder_path, model_path)
```
2. Test with new image
```python
new_image_path = "/path/to/new_image.jpg"
process_new_image(new_image_path, model_path)
```
# Results
The system provides:
- Person identification (if recognized)
- Detected emotion (with Portuguese translation)
- Face coordinates in the image
- Facial feature vector
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix)

# Limitations
- Requires images with clearly visible faces
- Performance may vary with lighting conditions and angles
- Unregistered persons are classified as "Unknown"
